# Peripheral Node

Choose the Arduino boilerplate code from this directory. The most basic one which constantly reads a single sensor data and shares it to the network can be found in the `basic_node.ino` file.

The only thing that you might need to change in that file is the `SENSOR_INPUT_PIN` constant at the top of the file.

After modifying the code, upload it on your Arduino!
